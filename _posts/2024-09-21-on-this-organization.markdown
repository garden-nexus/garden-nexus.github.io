Recently, I’ve been having a lot of conversations with friends about finding that thing in life that really drives you with regards to a career. 

In all honestly, It’s been difficult for me to really conceptualize what that is for me.  I do know the things that I’m passionate about the most in my personal life, and those concepts and tasks that interest me the most with work. But a connection between the two seems convoluted outside of a few ideas.

And that basically brings in the point of this organization: **I’m intending for this to serve as an exploration and deeper dive into the cross-section of those two groups of things.** I also intend to use this as a garden log & planner of sorts (since everything is very much effected by what’s growing/planted); documenting seed-starting, transplanting, growth updates, harvesting, etc. 

So I’m not really sure what to call this (a conglomeration maybe?), but I think that in itself is a good thing. Maybe _nothing_ comes from this, or maybe _everything_ comes from this, that’s okay too!
