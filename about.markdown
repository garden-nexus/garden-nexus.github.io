The purpose of Garden Nexus is to explore the _always_ evolving relationship between technology and nature. The scope for all of the encapsulated components (repos, designs, schematics, etc.) is focused strictly on a home garden and the surrounding native (_possibly invasive_) flora & fauna. This aims to be a continous journey and collection of research, projects, and ongoing work, in an attempt to further an understanding of how mesh networking technologies can positively benefit the environment. Additionally, the home garden serves as a platform to explore grassroots conservation and sustainability practices.
